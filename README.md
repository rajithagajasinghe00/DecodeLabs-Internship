# Data Analytics Projects

Three beginner data analytics projects, each built around the same orders
dataset, done in Python using Google Colab.

## How to run any project

1. Click its **Open in Colab** badge (or the notebook file, then the
   "Open in Colab" button GitHub shows above the preview)
2. Run the first cell — it will ask you to upload a CSV file
3. Run the remaining cells one by one (Shift+Enter)

Each notebook works with any orders-style CSV — column names used in the
examples (`Product`, `TotalPrice`, `OrderID`, etc.) may need to be swapped
for your own dataset's column names, and each notebook says so at the
relevant step.

## About the dataset

An e-commerce orders dataset — one row per order, with columns like
`OrderID`, `Date`, `Product`, `Quantity`, `UnitPrice`, `TotalPrice`,
`PaymentMethod`, `OrderStatus`, and `ReferralSource`.

## Suggested order

Run them in sequence — Project 1's cleaned output is a good input for
Project 2 and 3, though each notebook can also be run on its own.
